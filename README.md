### Hackathon Category
* Accessibility Advocates: Use Deepgram to improve user accessibility. Think about user input, accessing media or live events, and improving understanding.

## What It Does
RRP is a utility tool to increase the accessibility of content on YouTube. There are many reasons why someone might prefer an emailed transcript over the original video, some of which include:
* Limited hearing ability.
* Captions are not available for that video.
* Wifi access will be limited at a time when the user could watch the video.
* To be able to search for keywords and only digest the parts they are interested in.
* To use the content in an article or research project. 

## Dependencies 
* [YouTube mp3 Downloader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/youtube-mp3-downloader) - Youtube MP3 Downloader is a module which allows to specify YouTube videos from which the audio data should be extracted, converted to MP3, and stored on disk.

* [ffmpeg-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg-static) - ffmpeg static binaries for Mac OSX, Linux, Windows.
* [SendGrid Mail](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sendgrid/mail) - This is a dedicated service for interaction with the mail endpoint of the SendGrid v3 API.
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
* [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#file-system) - The fs module enables interacting with the file system in a way modeled on standard POSIX functions.
